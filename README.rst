  :alt: Documentation Status

A python package for calculating the expected sensitivities of 21cm experiments
to the Epoch of Reionization and/or Cosmic Dawn power spectrum.

Installation
============
For Users
---------
Clone/download the package and run ``pip install [-e] .`` in the top-level.

If you are a ``conda`` user (which we recommend), you may want to install the following
using ``conda`` rather than them being automatically installed with pip::

    $ conda install numpy scipy pyyaml astropy

For Development
---------------
Clone/download the package and run ``pip install [-e] .[dev]`` in the top-level.

Run ``pre-commit install; pre-commit install --hook-type=commit-msg`` to install the
pre-commit hook checks.

We recommend using the ``commitizen`` tool to write commit messages -- we use the commit
messages to do our versioning!

Usage
=====
There are two ways to use this code: as a python library or via the CLI.
More documentation on using the library can found
`in the docs <https://21cmSense.readthedocs.org>`_, especially in the
`getting started tutorial <https://21cmsense.readthedocs.io/en/latest/tutorials/getting_started.html>`_
A more involved introduction to the CLI can be found in the
`CLI tutorial <https://21cmsense.readthedocs.io/en/latest/tutorials/cli_tutorial.html>`_.

As a taste, the simplest possible usage is by using the CLI as follows::

    $ sense calc-sense <SENSITIVITY_CONFIG_FILE.yml>

Other options to the ``calc-sense`` program can be read by using::

    $ sense calc-sense --help

An example config file is in this repository under ``example_configs/sensitivity_hera.yml``,
which details the various parameters that can be set. In all, three configuration files
are required -- one defining an ``observatory``, another defining an ``observation``, and the
``sensitivity`` one already mentioned.

The CLI can also be used in a two-step process, by running::

    $ sense grid-baselines <OBSERVATION_CONFIG_FILE.yml>

and then::

    $ sense calc-sense <SENSITIVITY_CONFIG_FILE.yml> --array-file=<ARRAY_FILE.pkl>

where the ``ARRAY_FILE`` is produced in the first step (and its location is printed during
the execution).

Running Tests
=============
An example of how to run tests is in the Github Workflow ``testsuite.yaml``. In short,
just run ``pytest`` in the top-level directory after installing the package.
